			<div class="left_2"><p>This teerth came into its establishment in 12th century in the memory of 1st Dadaguru Acharya Shri Kushal Suriji. Born in 1076 at Dholka city in Gujarat, Dadaguru Kushal Suriji headed towards Sanyam path in the age of 9 years. With the help of his knowledge of Adhyatmic Shanti (Spiriual calmness), Sanyam (control) & Tapobal (power of spiritual practices) dada guru compelled many Rajput kings to follow the path of Ahinsa [(non-violence), the path shown by Bhagwan Mahaveer]. He passed away in 1155 at the age of 79 years. It was the effect of his Tapobal (power of spiritual practices) that the chadar, cholpatta & munhpatti, present on his body at the time of his death, automatically thrown out of the flames of the chita which are still preserved at the Gyan Bhandar of Jaisalmer in a glass box.</p></div>
